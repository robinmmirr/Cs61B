# SLLists
IntList not optimal, needs to read and maintain.
- Naked recursive data structure: 
    - In order to use an IntList correctly, the programmer must understand and utilize recursion even for simple list related task.
    - require too many helper methods

## Improvement #1 Rebranding

Our IntList:

``` java
public class IntList {
    public int first;
    public IntList rest;

    public IntList(int f, IntList r) {
        first = f;
        rest = r;
    }
...
```

Our first step:
    - change names
    - through away all helper methods

``` java
// intNode is a class kind of like IntList--> have a first item, the a next item that is also a IntNode-- recursive
public class IntNode {
    public int item;
    public IntNode next;
// when creating a IntNode, give a item i and then a IntNode n
    public IntNode(int i, IntNode n) {
        item = i;
        next = n;
    }
}
```

## Improvement #2: Bureaucracy
We are creating a separate class called SLList:
```java
public class SLList {
    public IntNode first;
// in SLList, when we create a SLList, we do not put null in the method for user, instead we put in inside of the method
    public SLList(int x) {
        first = new IntNode(x, null);
    }
}
```

When creating a SLList:
``` java
IntList L1 = new IntList(5, null);
SLList L2  = new SLList(5);
```
SLList hides the detail of null existing in the list.


## addFirst and getFirst
In IntList, we do ```L = new IntList(5,L)``` to add a new element to the list.

In SLList:

``` java
public class SLList {
    
    public IntNode first;

    public SLList(int x) {
        first = new IntNode(x, null);
    }

    /** Adds an item to the front of the list. */
    // when adding a new element, we alter "first" to a IntNode with x as first item, and first as the next item.
    public void addFirst(int x) {
        first = new IntNode(x, first);
    }
    /* when we do get the first item, we can just call the item from "first" intNode:
    public class IntNode {
    public int item;
    public IntNode next;
    So first.item can call the first item of that intNode
    */
    public int getFirst() {
    return first.item;
}
}
```
## Improvement #3: Public vs. Private
We can make the ```first``` var be pravite so no one can modify it.

``` java
public class SLList {
    private IntNode first;
...
```

## Improvement #4: Nested Classes
We can move the IntNode class into SLList class since it is a supportive class of SLList class

``` java
public class SLList {
    // if the nested class has no need to use any of the instance methods or vars of SLList, we can declare the nested class static.
    // meaning the method inside the static class cannot access any of the members of the enclosing class.
    // no method in intnode would be able to access firt, addfirst, or getfirst
       public static class IntNode {
            public int item;
            public IntNode next;
            public IntNode(int i, IntNode n) {
                item = i;
                next = n;
            }
       }

       private IntNode first; 

       public SLList(int x) {
           first = new IntNode(x, null);
       } 
...
```
## addLast() and size()
addLast:
```java
public void addLast(int x) {
    IntNode p = first;

    /* Advance p to the end of the list. */
    // have an iterator p and have it iterate through the end
    while (p.next != null) {
        p = p.next;
    }
    p.next = new IntNode(x, null);
}
```
size(), since SLList does not have a ```rest``` variable, we will use a private helper method for the size method
``` java
/** Returns the size of the list starting at IntNode p. */
private static int size(IntNode p) {
    if (p.next == null) {
        return 1;
    }

    return 1 + size(p.next);
}
```

```java
public int size() {
    return size(first);
}
```
## Improvement #5: Caching

The above method will take too long if our list is big, so we want to add a size variable to the SLList class that tracks the current size:

``` java
public class SLList {
    ... /* IntNode declaration omitted. */
    private IntNode first;
    // add a pravite int size
    private int size;

    public SLList(int x) {
        first = new IntNode(x, null);
        // when first create the list, we set size to 1
        size = 1;
    }

    public void addFirst(int x) {
        first = new IntNode(x, first);
        // when we add element to the list, size += 1
        size += 1;
    }

    public int size() {
        return size;
    }
    ...
}
```
## Improvement #6: The Empty List
Advantagees of SLList:
- Users of a SLList never see the IntList class.
   - Simpler to use.
   - More efficient addFirst method (exercise 2.2.1).
   - Avoids errors or malfeasance by IntList users.
- Faster size method than possible with IntList.
- able to easily implement a constructor that creates an empty list:
``` java
public SLList() {
    // set fist to null if the list is empty
    first = null;
    size = 0;
}
```
However, this will cause the addFirst() method to crush:

``` java
public void addLast(int x) {
    size += 1;
    // since first is null if the list is empty, this will cause issue for the method
    IntNode p = first;
    while (p.next != null) {
        p = p.next;
    }

    p.next = new IntNode(x, null);
}
```
We can add a if statement to isolate the empty list:

``` java 
public void addLast(int x) {
    size += 1;
// use if statement to creat a special case for empty list
    if (first == null) {
        first = new IntNode(x, null);
        return;
    }

    IntNode p = first;
    while (p.next != null) {
        p = p.next;
    }

    p.next = new IntNode(x, null);
}
```

## Improvement #6b: Sentinel Nodes

A cleaner, though less obvious solution, is to make it so that all SLLists are the "same", even if they are empty. We can do this by creating a special node that is always there, which we will call a ```sentinel node```. The sentinel node will hold a value, which we won't care about.
``` java
public void addLast(int x) {
    size += 1;
    IntNode p = sentinel;
    while (p.next != null) {
        p = p.next;
    }

    p.next = new IntNode(x, null);
}
```

A SLList with a sentinel node has at least the following invariants:

- The sentinel reference always points to a sentinel node.
- The front item (if it exists), is always at sentinel.next.item.
- The size variable is always the total number of items that have been added.
